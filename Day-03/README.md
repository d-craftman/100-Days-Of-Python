# Day 03: Logic Gates & Decision-making Systems

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement Conditional Logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
- Master Logical Operators and Comparison Operators.
- Build a "Gatekeeper" system to automate business decision-making.

## 🛠️ The Build: Studio Project Gatekeeper
Every project isn't a fit for every workflow. Today's build for @TheCraftroomStudios is a script that evaluates incoming project budgets and automatically categorizes them into service tiers.

### Key Logic:
- **Conditionals:** Setting thresholds for project intake (High-Priority vs. Standard vs. Referral).
- **Comparison Operators:** Using `>`, `<`, and `==` to validate budget feasibility.
- **Error Handling:** Basic input validation to ensure non-negative financial data.

## 🚀 Technical Takeaway
Programming is essentially the art of managing "State." By implementing Control Flow, the @TheCraftroomStudios engine can now differentiate between data points and act accordingly without human intervention.
