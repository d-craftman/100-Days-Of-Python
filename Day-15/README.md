# Day 15: Structured Data with JSON

## 🎯 Objectives
- Transition from plain text (`.txt`) to structured data (`.json`).
- Master the `json` module: `json.dump()` and `json.load()`.
- Implement a persistent Dictionary-based database.

## 🛠️ The Build: Craftroom Digital Archive (v2.0)
Plain text files are great for logs, but they are hard to search and organize. Today’s build for @TheCraftroomStudios upgrades our storage to **JSON**. By saving our client profiles as JSON objects, we maintain the "Dictionary" structure even after the program closes.

### Key Features:
- **Data Serialization:** Converting complex Python dictionaries into JSON strings.
- **State Restoration:** Loading the entire studio database back into memory on startup.
- **Nested Storage:** Handling multiple client profiles within a single JSON file.

## 🚀 Technical Takeaway
JSON is the language of the internet. By mastering JSON persistence, the studio is now ready to interact with Web APIs, Cloud Databases, and modern Frontend frameworks.
