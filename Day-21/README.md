# Day 21: Data Categorization & Multi-Criteria Filtering

## 🎯 Objectives
- Expand JSON schema to include "Category" or "Tags."
- Implement filtering logic to view subsets of data.
- Master the use of keyword arguments in functions.

## 🛠️ The Build: Craftroom Departmental Filter
A studio isn't just one big pile of work; it’s a collection of departments. Today’s build for @TheCraftroomStudios upgrades our intake system to categorize projects by type. We are also building a "Filter View" that allows us to see only "Design" projects or only "Web" projects, giving the studio manager a clearer view of departmental workload.

### Key Features:
- **Categorized Intake:** Adding a `category` field to the project dictionary.
- **Sub-List Generation:** Using list comprehensions to filter the database by department.
- **Revenue by Category:** Calculating how much each specific department is earning.

## 🚀 Technical Takeaway
Structured data is only powerful if you can slice it. Learning to filter by categories is the first step toward building a real "Analytics Dashboard."
