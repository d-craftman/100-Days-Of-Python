# Day 05: Data Collections & List Architectures

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand Python Lists as ordered collections.
- Master List manipulation: `.append()`, `.remove()`, and `.sort()`.
- Implement dynamic storage for the Studio's active project queue.

## 🛠️ The Build: Craftroom Project Queue
As @TheCraftroomStudios scales, we need more than just single variables. Today's build focuses on a **Project Queue Manager**—a system to track, add, and organize multiple client projects simultaneously.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Growth:** Using `.append()` to add new clients to the workflow.
- **Queue Management:** Utilizing `len()` to track studio capacity in real-time.
- **Data Organization:** Implementing sorting logic to prioritize the project pipeline.

## 🚀 Technical Takeaway
Variables store values; Lists store **potential.** By mastering collections, we transition from building "scripts" to building "databases."
