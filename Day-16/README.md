# Day 16: Data Manipulation & State Management

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement "Search and Update" logic within JSON datasets.
- Master conditional loops to find specific dictionary objects in a list.
- Manage project lifecycles (Lead -> Active -> Completed).

## 🛠️ The Build: Craftroom Status Manager
A static database is just a list; a dynamic database is a tool. Today’s build for @TheCraftroomStudios introduces **State Management**. We are adding the ability to search for an existing project by name and update its status, allowing the studio to track progress in real-time.

### Key Features:
- **Targeted Search:** Iterating through the JSON list to find a specific project.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Modifying a single key-value pair without affecting the rest of the data.
- **Persistence 2.0:** Re-saving the entire modified list back to `database.json`.

## 🚀 Technical Takeaway
Real-world apps are rarely about adding new data; they are mostly about managing existing data. Learning to find and modify specific entries is a fundamental backend skill.
