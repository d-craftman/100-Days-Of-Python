# Day 04: Boolean Logic & Complex Conditionals

## 🎯 Objectives
- Master Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- Implement Nested Conditionals for specialized decision trees.
- Refine the "Studio Gatekeeper" with multi-factor authentication.

## 🛠️ The Build: Advanced Project Validator
Yesterday was about simple budget tiers. Today, the @TheCraftroomStudios engine evolves to evaluate two factors: **Budget** AND **Project Type**. 

### Key Logic:
- **AND Operator:** Validating that a project is both financially viable AND within our service scope.
- **OR Operator:** Flagging projects that either need immediate attention or have been referred by a VIP partner.
- **Boolean States:** Managing "True/False" flags for studio availability.

## 🚀 Technical Takeaway
Code doesn't just need to "run"; it needs to "discern." By combining multiple conditions, we reduce the "False Positives" in our automated onboarding pipeline.
