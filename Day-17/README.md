# Day 17: Interactive Menu Systems & Program Flow

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement a persistent "Main Loop" for user interaction.
- Use conditional branching to trigger specific functions from `tools.py`.
- Build a clean CLI (Command Line Interface) for @TheCraftroomStudios.

## 🛠️ The Build: The Studio Command Center
A professional tool doesn't just run once and quit; it waits for instructions. Today’s build refactors `main.py` into a **Command Center**. We are creating a loop that presents the user with options: Add a Project, View Database, Update Status, or Exit.

### Key Features:
- **Persistent Interface:** The program only closes when the user explicitly chooses "Exit."
- **Function Mapping:** Mapping user input (1, 2, 3) to the corresponding logic in our backend.
- **Improved UX:** Adding clear headers and feedback messages to make the studio software feel "premium."

## 🚀 Technical Takeaway
The "Main Loop" is the heart of most software, from simple scripts to massive video games. Mastering program flow ensures that your application is intuitive and easy to navigate.
