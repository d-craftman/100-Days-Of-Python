# Day 07: Modular Architectures & Functions

## 🎯 Objectives
- Define and call custom Functions using the `def` keyword.
- Understand Parameters and Arguments for dynamic data processing.
- Implement Return Statements to capture functional outputs.

## 🛠️ The Build: Craftroom Utility Engine
Efficiency at @TheCraftroomStudios is driven by "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principles. Today’s build refactors our previous logic into modular functions. This allows us to trigger project validations, formatting, and calculations instantly across the entire system.

### Key Features:
- **Modular Design:** Creating standalone functions for `calculate_deposit()` and `format_id()`.
- **Reusable Logic:** Decoupling the business rules from the main script execution.
- **Input/Output Mapping:** Passing raw data into functions and receiving sanitized, processed results.

## 🚀 Technical Takeaway
Functions are the building blocks of professional software. By moving from procedural scripts to functional programming, we create code that is easier to test, debug, and scale.
