# Day 13: Dictionary Comprehensions & Data Mapping

## 🎯 Objectives
- Extend comprehension logic to Key-Value pairs.
- Map and transform existing dictionaries into new structures in a single line.
- Implement conditional logic for complex data filtering.

## 🛠️ The Build: Craftroom Portfolio Analyzer
Managing a growing database at @TheCraftroomStudios requires rapid data transformation. Today’s build focuses on **Dictionary Comprehensions**. Instead of looping through every client profile to update statuses or filter by industry, we are now building "Snapshots" of our data instantly.

### Key Features:
- **Status Mapping:** Creating a sub-dictionary of only 'Active' projects from a master list.
- **Budget Adjustments:** Applying mass currency conversions or fee updates across all client profiles in one line.
- **Dynamic Key Generation:** Swapping Keys and Values for reverse-lookup operations.

## 🚀 Technical Takeaway
Mastering comprehensions for both lists and dictionaries marks the transition from "Writing Scripts" to "Architecting Data." It reduces overhead and makes the studio's backend lean and efficient.
