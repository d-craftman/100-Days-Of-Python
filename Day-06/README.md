# Day 06: Iterative Logic & Control Loops

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement `while` loops for continuous program execution.
- Utilize `for` loops to iterate over data collections.
- Master loop control statements: `break` and `continue`.

## 🛠️ The Build: Infinite Onboarding Engine
Manual execution is the enemy of scale. Today’s build for @TheCraftroomStudios introduces an **Iterative Intake System**. Instead of restarting the script for every client, the system now runs indefinitely, processing an unlimited number of entries until a termination command is issued.

### Key Features:
- **Infinite Loops:** Using `while True` to keep the "Studio Gate" open.
- **Iteration:** Using `for` loops to generate formatted reports from the project list.
- **Sentinel Values:** Implementing a "quit" command to safely close the system.

## 🚀 Technical Takeaway
Loops are the "engine room" of programming. They allow us to handle 10 or 10,000 data points with the same amount of code.
